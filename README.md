I have created a project for KBC (Kaun Banega Crorepati) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
In this project, the user first needs to sign up by filling out the signup form. 
After that, they will be directed to the game page where they can start playing.
On the game page, a series of questions will appear one after another, and the user needs to select the correct answer for each question.
The game continues until all questions are answered, and then it concludes.
